                        it has to be boring. Quite the opposite!</p>

                    <h3>Sports Photography</h3>
                    <p>Sports photography is awesome. Sitting on the sidelines with a massive telephoto allows me to get
                        right into the action — I love shooting sports where there's a lot of explosive movement.</p>

                        or whatever, that sort of defines a person.</p>

                    <p>The nice thing about shooting architecture (in my opinion) is that it's so easy to do. Seriously,
                        just pick up your camera and get out there.</p>

                    <h3>Animal Photography</h3>
                    <p>Whenever I'm travelling I always make sure to pack gear that allows me to capture the local
                        wildlife. The eagle that takes flight in this picture is probably my most prized image.</p>

                    <p>Landscape photography just never gets old. Someone told me that those are the kinds of pictures
                        you never look. Well, I don't agree.</p>
